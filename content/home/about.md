# Biography

Since I started my academic career I have been interested in how mathematics can
describe and be used to model the natural world. Machine Learning lies at an
intersection of maths, programming and cognition that I find to be ideally
suited to my strengths.

I am currently doing a PhD in Machine Learning under Massimiliano Pontil and
Carlo Ciliberto investigating Active Learning.
